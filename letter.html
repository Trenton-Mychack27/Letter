            <h3>Artistic Inspirations</h3>
            <p>It's great to hear about your interest in the historical influences on modern art. Here are some of my favorite movements and their impact:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Impressionism</dt>
                <dd>Characterized by small, thin brush strokes and emphasis on accurate depiction of light. It has profoundly influenced the approach to outdoor painting.</dd>
                <dt>Abstract Expressionism</dt>
                <dd>This movement has led to the exploration of non-representational forms and had a significant impact on contemporary art's freedom of expression.</dd>
                <dt>Pop Art</dt>
                <dd>A pivotal movement that blurred the boundaries between 'high' art and popular culture, leading to innovative use of imagery from mass culture.</dd>
            </dl>
